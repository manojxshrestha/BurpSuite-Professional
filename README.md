<br>
â€¢ You have the appropriate version of Java installed and configured.
<br>
â€¢ The paths to the JAR files in the burp.sh script are correct.
</br>

- ### Verifying Java Version

> To check your Java version, run:

```bash
java -version
```

> If you are using an older version (like OpenJDK ðŸ˜Ž, consider installing a newer version:
